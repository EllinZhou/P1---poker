In this project, we'll be developing a working game of Poker. Along the way, we'll be using the Python concepts we've learned in Year 1, as well as practicing Object Oriented design principles. We'll also be learning how to write effective tests in order to practice good software engineering. You don't need to have ever played Poker to complete this project, we'll teach you the rules.

Rules
- Cards: poker cards, has suit and value
- Deck: a set of cards
- Player: multiple players in the game, each is dealt 2 random cards and uses money to bet
- Pot: all the money that all players have bet


Approach
- Read through the file, reading any method headers and TODO comments.
- Itâ€™s best to write code incrementally, doing small chunks and testing them before moving on. Start with small classes


TODO
- Cards.py
- Deck.py
- Player.py
- Pot.py
